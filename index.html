            <p>Mage and Herbalist
            Accomplished mage with several years of magic wielding experience. I have assisted many a party of explorers, travelers, and adventurers through dungeons, across bogs and swamps, dark forests, haunted forests, enchanted forest, you'd be surprised by how many forests there are. I digress, I have the ability to not only assist with fighting but healing, as I am also skilled in herbalism. All the benefits of having a cleric around but without the religious piety clashing with any of your party members own philosophies.
